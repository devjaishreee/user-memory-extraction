# User Memory Extraction System (LLM + FAISS)

A factual memory system for AI agents that uses GPT-4 to extract user traits (like preferences and routines) from conversations, stores them in a FAISS vector database using Sentence-BERT embeddings, and retrieves relevant memories for personalized, context-aware responses.

---

## Features

- âœ… Factual memory extraction via GPT-4
- âœ… Embedding-based semantic memory using Sentence-BERT
- âœ… Fast vector search with FAISS
- âœ… Context injection for dynamic personalization
- âœ… Modular, extensible, and ready for production

---

## Tech Stack

- `openai` â€“ GPT-4 for factual extraction
- `sentence-transformers` â€“ SBERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for text embeddings
- `faiss-cpu` â€“ Scalable memory retrieval engine
- `python-dotenv` â€“ Secure API key management
- `numpy` â€“ Vector math

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone and install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-memory-extraction.git
cd user-memory-extraction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add your OpenAI API key
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Run the main pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Sample Output

```
Query: When should I notify the user?
Retrieved Memories:
1. User prefers night-time reminders
```
